# QuickStock-Rust



This project is for CS4340 - Software Maintenance at UCCS. We chose to change an open source github project from Python to Rust (and some other things).


## Dependancies
Must have Rust downloaded, all other dependancies should be installed when running the program.

**Download Rust here** (either 32 or 64 bit versions should work): https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Use the default intallation for this app.

After installation, restart your IDE (we are using VScode). Then move on to the run instructions.


## Run Instructions
To compose the proram on your machiene, go to ther terminal and execute these commands:
```
cargo build
```
```
cargo run
```

To terminate the program close the window normally (the X button in the top corner or the window) or terminate the process in the terminal (ctrl + C).
